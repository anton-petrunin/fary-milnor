\section{F치ry}\label{sec:fary}

In this section, we sketch the solution of Istv치n F치ry \cite{fary} which was published before Milnor's proof.

We start with Crofton-type formulas for total curvature \cite[Proposition 4.1]{sullivan-curves}.
Given a curve $\alpha$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and a unit vector $u$, denote by $\alpha_{u^\perp}$ 
and $\alpha_u$ the projections of $\alpha$ to the plane perpendicular to $u$ and the line parallel to $u$ respectively.
Let us denote by $\overline{f(u)}$ the average value of $f(u)$ for a function $f\:\mathbb{S}^2\to\mathbb{R}$.

\begin{thm}{Crofton-type formula}\label{prop:tc-crofton}
Let $\alpha$ be a polygonal curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Then
\begin{align*}
\tc\alpha
&=\overline{\tc{\alpha_{u^\perp}}}
=\overline{\tc{\alpha_u}}.
\end{align*}
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
Observe that it is sufficient to check the identities for $\alpha$ made of two edges.
Denote its external angle by $\phi$, so $\tc\alpha=\phi$.
Observe that each term in the formula is proportional to $\phi$.
Therefore it is sufficient to consider the case $\phi=\pi$.

In other words, we can assume that $\alpha$ is made of two edges that turn in the opposite direction.
Note that the same holds for $\alpha_{u^\perp}$ if $u$ is not parallel to an edge of $\alpha$.
Similarly, the same holds for $\alpha_u$ if $u$ is not perpendicular to an edge of $\alpha$.
Therefore, $\tc{\alpha_{u^\perp}}=\tc{\alpha_u}=\pi$ for almost all $u\in\mathbb{S}^2$.
In particular, $\overline{\tc{\alpha_{u^\perp}}}=\overline{\tc{\alpha_u}}=\pi$ which proves the statement.

The original version of Milnor's proof 
used the identity $\tc\alpha=\overline{\tc{\alpha_u}}$;
in Fenner's version of his proof, it was hidden under the carpet.

F치ry's proof is based on the identity $\tc\alpha=\overline{\tc{\alpha_{u^\perp}}}$ and the following inequality for total curvature.
Suppose $\alpha=p_1\dots p_n$ is a simple closed polygonal curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $o\notin\alpha$.
Let us define the \emph{angular length} of $\alpha$ with respect to $o$ as the sum
\[\Psi_o(\alpha)=\measuredangle p_{1} o p_{2}+\dots+\measuredangle p_{n-1} o p_{n}+\measuredangle p_{n} o p_{1}.\]

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:angular-length}
For any closed simple polygonal curve and any $o\notin\alpha$, we have 
\[\Psi_o(\alpha)\le \tc{\alpha}.\]
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\alpha=p_1\dots p_n$; for each $i$, set 
\begin{align*}
\phi_i&=\pi-\measuredangle p_{i-1}p_ip_{i+1},
\\
\psi_i&=\measuredangle p_{i-1} o p_{i},
\\
\theta_i&=\measuredangle o p_i p_{i+1}.
\end{align*}
Here we assume that indexes are taken modulo $n$; in particular, $p_{n}=p_0$.

Note that $\phi_i$ is the external angle at $p_i$;
therefore 
\[\tc\alpha= \phi_1+\dots+\phi_n\]

The directions of $p_i-p_{i-1}$, $o-p_i$, and $p_{i+1}-p_i$ make angles 
$\psi_i+\theta_{i-1}$, $\theta_i$, and $\phi_i$ to each other.
Applying the triangle inequality for these angles, we get
\[\phi_i\ge \psi_i+\theta_{i-1}-\theta_i.\]
Summing up, we get
\[\phi_1+\dots+\phi_n\ge \psi_1+\dots+\psi_n,\]
and the result follows.

\parit{Proof of the main theorem.}
Consider a projection of the knot to a plane in \emph{general position}
(this time it means that the self-intersections of the projection are at most double and the projection of each edge is not degenerate).
The obtained closed polygonal curve $\alpha_{u^\perp}=p_1p_2\dots p_n$ divides the plane into domains, one of which is unbounded, denote it by $U$, and the others are bounded.

First, note that all domains can be colored in a chessboard order;
that is, they can be colored in black and white in such a way that domains with common borderline get different colors \cite[Exercise 2.27]{adams}.
If the unbounded domain is colored in white and every other domain is colored in black, then one can untie the knot by flipping these domains one by one.%
\footnote{It is instructive to give a formal proof of the last statement; that is, \textit{show that if there is only one white region, then $\alpha$ is trivial}.}

Therefore, among the bounded domains there is a white domain, denote it by $D$.
The domain $D$ cannot adjoin %the word adjoin is used for countries, and I guess it can be used in the plane. I agree.
$U$, since they have the same color.
Fix a point $o$ in this domain.

Since any ray from $o$ crosses $\alpha_{u^\perp}$ twice, we get $\Psi_o(\alpha_{u^\perp})\ge 4\cdot\pi$;
that is, the angular length of $\alpha_{u^\perp}$ with respect to $o$ is at least $4\cdot\pi$. 
By \ref{prop:angular-length}, we have 
\[\tc{\alpha_{u^\perp}}\ge4\cdot\pi.\]
This is true for any $u$ in general position.
The remaining directions contribute nothing to the average value.
It remains to apply the Crofton-type formula $\tc{\alpha}=\overline{\tc{\alpha_{u^\perp}}}$.
