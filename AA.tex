\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Suppose that a closed curve $\alpha$ crosses a line at four points $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$.
Assume that the points $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ appear on the line in that order and they appear on the curve $\alpha$ in the order $a$, $c$, $b$, $d$.
Show that 
\[\tc\alpha\ge 4\cdot\pi.\]
\end{thm}

A line crossing a knot at four points as in the exercise is called \emph{alternating quadrisecants}.
It turns out that any nontrivial knot admits an alternating quadrisecants \cite{denne};
it provides yet another proof of the F\'ary--Milnor theorem.


\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}
Show that given any real number $\Phi$ there is a knot $\beta$ such that any knot isotopic to $\beta$ has total curvature at least~$\Phi$.   
\end{thm}

\parit{Hint:} Use that there are knots with arbitrary large \emph{bridge number}, see for example \cite{schultens} and the references therein.
